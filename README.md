# 🌐 AWS Virtual Internship - Forage

Welcome to my project repository for the **AWS Virtual Internship** hosted on **Forage** in collaboration with **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. This internship provided hands-on experience in designing cloud-based architecture and applying real-world AWS services to solve business challenges.

---

## 📌 Overview

The AWS Virtual Internship simulated the role of a Cloud Practitioner/Architect working with a startup client to migrate their infrastructure to the cloud. The experience focused on designing a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective architecture using AWS services, while considering real-world constraints and business goals.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Cloud fundamentals and core AWS services
- Designing highly available and scalable architectures
- Cost optimization strategies using cloud-native tools
- Blue/Green deployment strategies to reduce downtime
- Real-world application of Route 53, Elastic Load Balancer, EC2, RDS, S3, and CodePipeline
- Evaluating trade-offs between AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, Fargate, and Lightsail
- Collaboration and communication in a cloud architecture team setting

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Services Used

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** – For application hosting and auto-scaling
- **Amazon EC2** – Virtual server infrastructure managed by Beanstalk
- **Amazon RDS** – Managed relational database for backend storage
- **Amazon S3** – Static file storage for media and assets
- **AWS CodePipeline** – CI/CD automation for smooth deployments
- **Elastic Load Balancing** – To distribute incoming traffic and support Blue/Green deployments
- **Amazon Route 53** – DNS service for routing user requests
- **Multi-AZ Deployment** (optional) – For added redundancy and high availability

---

## 📈 Project Outcome

As part of the internship, I designed an architecture for a Python-based web and API application that could:
- Automatically scale based on traffic
- Minimize downtime using deployment strategies
- Store data securely and reliably
- Stay cost-effective as traffic and data grow

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

This internship was a fantastic opportunity to gain practical AWS experience and apply theoretical cloud knowledge in a realistic scenario. It has strengthened my interest in **cloud computing, DevOps, and system architecture**, and I’m excited to continue building cloud-native applications.
